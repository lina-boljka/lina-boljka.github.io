I currently work at the Department of Atmospheric Science, Colorado State University. My research focuses on climate dynamics, e.g. storm track dynamics, stratosphere-troposphere interactions, wave-mean flow interactions, and (regional) climate variability and change. My research interests also include asymptotic methods, model hierarchies, teleconnection patterns, subseasonal-to-seasonal prediction, and interdisciplinary studies.

For more details on my work see my blog posts and publications.
