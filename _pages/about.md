I currently work at the Department of Atmospheric Science, Colorado State University. My research focuses on climate dynamics, e.g. storm track dynamics, stratosphere-troposphere interactions, wave-mean flow interactions, and (regional) climate variability and change. My research interests also include asymptotic methods, model hierarchies, teleconnection patterns, subseasonal-to-seasonal prediction, and interdisciplinary studies.

For more details on my work see my blog posts and publications.


-----------------------------------------------------------------
I collaborate with scientists in different fields in order to address environmental, ethical, legal etc. implications of climate change (collaborators: <a href="https://chem.ku.dk/ansatte/alle/?pure=en/persons/81047">Matthew Johnson</a>, Thomas Sparks, Benjamin Moss, Linnea Luupala, Vanessa Burns).

I also collaborate with my colleagues from Slovenia (<a href="https://zaplotnik.github.io">Žiga Zaplotnik</a>, <a href="https://ninacrnivec.github.io">Nina Črnivec</a>, Aljoša Slameršak); some links related to Slovenian meterology can be found <a href="https://ninacrnivec.github.io/meteoSI/">here</a>.
