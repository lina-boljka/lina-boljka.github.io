I currently works at the Department of Atmospheric Science, Colorado State University. My research focuses on climate dynamics, looking at storm tracks, stratosphere-troposphere interactions, wave-mean flow interactions, and (regional) climate variability and change. My research interests also include asymptotic methods, model hierarchies, teleconnection patterns and sub-seasonal to seasonal timescales.
