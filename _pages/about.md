I currently work at the Department of Atmospheric Science, Colorado State University. My research focuses on climate dynamics, e.g. storm track dynamics, stratosphere-troposphere interactions, wave-mean flow interactions, (regional) climate variability and change, and their impacts. My research interests also include asymptotic methods, model hierarchies, teleconnection patterns, subseasonal-to-seasonal prediction, and interdisciplinary studies. I am also active in communicating climate change in Slovenia (<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/14kKhqvhMYvILBhosecHA4HwMZpYnX338/view">RESCCCUE</a>).

For more details on my work see my blog posts and publications.
