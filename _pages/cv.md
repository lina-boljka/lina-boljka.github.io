* Autumn 2020 - Autumn 2023: Researcher / Postdoctoral Fellow
  * University of Bergen, Geophysical Institute & Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research 
  * Duties included: Analysing reanalysis, and climate model data to better understand climate variability and its role in long-term prediction (summertime blocking, Hadley cell, El Niño Southern Oscillation, Atlantic multidecadal variability, teleconnections). Additionally, I ran model experiments to better understand model biases in summertime atmospheric circulation. @Bjerknes Centre Prediction Unit @Climate Futures @BCCR Fast Track Initiative

  * Duties included: Analysing reanalysis, and idealised model output for better understanding of extratropical dynamics (storm tracks, stratosphere-troposphere interaction). 
  * Visiting scientist at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München. 
  * Advisors: Prof. David W.J. Thompson, Prof. Thomas Birner (LMU)
  
* Autumn 2013- Summer 2014: Climatologist
  * Slovenian Environment Agency, Sector for Climatology

<!--Collaborations (external)
======
  I collaborate with experts in different fields (incl. <a href="https://chem.ku.dk/ansatte/alle/?pure=en/persons/81047">Matthew Johnson</a>, <a href="https://laverne.edu/directory/person/david-bickford/">David Bickford</a>, Thomas Sparks, Benjamin Moss, Linnea Luupala, Vanessa Burns)  in order to address environmental, ethical, legal etc. implications of climate change.

  I collaborate with my colleagues from Slovenia (<a href="https://zaplotnik.github.io">Žiga Zaplotnik</a>, <a href="https://ninacrnivec.github.io">Nina Črnivec</a>, <a href="https://ictaweb.uab.cat/personal_detail.php?id=4088">Aljoša Slameršak</a>, and others) mostly on informing the Slovenian general public and politicians of the climate change impacts and how to address them - projects <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/14kKhqvhMYvILBhosecHA4HwMZpYnX338/view?usp=sharing">RESCCCUE</a> & Podnebnik: <a href="https://podnebnik.org/en/">Website</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/podnebnik">@Twitter</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/podnebnik">@Medium</a>; some links related to Slovenian meterology can be found <a href="https://ninacrnivec.github.io/meteoSI/">here</a>.-->
