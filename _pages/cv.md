======
* Autumn 2018 - present: Postdoctoral Fellow
  * Colorado State University
  * Duties included: Analysing reanalysis, S2S model output, and idealised model output for better understanding of extratropical dynamics (storm tracks, stratosphere-troposphere interaction). 
  * Visiting scientist at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München. 
  * Supervisors: Prof. David W.J. Thompson, Prof. Thomas Birner (LMU)
  
* Autumn 2013- Summer 2014: Climatologist
  * Slovenian Environment Agency
  * Duties included: Analysing regional climate model data (CORDEX,ENSEMBLES) for regional climate change studies of Slovenia and Southeast Europe.
  
Education
======

Collaborations
======
  I collaborate with scientists in different fields in order to address environmental, ethical, legal etc. implications of climate change (collaborators: <a href="https://chem.ku.dk/ansatte/alle/?pure=en/persons/81047">Matthew Johnson</a>, Thomas Sparks, Benjamin Moss, Linnea Luupala, Vanessa Burns).

  I also collaborate with my colleagues from Slovenia (<a href="https://zaplotnik.github.io">Žiga Zaplotnik</a>, <a href="https://ninacrnivec.github.io">Nina Črnivec</a>, Aljoša Slameršak); some links related to Slovenian meterology can be found <a href="https://ninacrnivec.github.io/meteoSI/">here</a>.
